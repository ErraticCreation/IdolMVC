# What is IdolMVC
**IdolMVC** is a custom PHP Framework project that I am creating in order to better understand the internal workings of the MVC software architectural design pattern.
### Release Information
It is my intention to keep building onto this project once I have the initial skeleton built out. The version number will hit 1.0 once it has reached a state where a basic web app may be built using it, complete with database interactions, functioning Models, Controllers and Dynamic Views. 
### Server Requirements
I will do my best to support PHP 5.6 and newer. But keep in mind that currently this project is being built and tested with **PHP 7.0.27** so that is what I'd recommend if you'd like to test it out yourself.

### License Info
This project utilizes **The MIT License**, for more information check the LICENSE file in the root directory.

##### Minor Note
Though I have had  a fair amount of experience programming over the past three years, I am very much a PHP beginner as I start this project, so if you happen to have any recommendations for how to improve this project or my code readability feel free to reach out and let me know.
