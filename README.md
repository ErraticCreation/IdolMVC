# What is IdolMVC
**IdolMVC** is a custom PHP Framework project that I am creating in order to better understand the internal workings of the MVC software architectural design pattern.
###### Current Version: 0.7
### Release Information
It is my intention to keep building onto this project once I have the initial skeleton built out. The version number will hit 1.0 once it has reached a state where a basic web app may be built using it, complete with database interactions, functioning Models, Controllers and Dynamic Views. 
### Server Requirements
I will do my best to support PHP 5.6 and newer. But keep in mind that currently this project is being built and tested with **PHP 7.0.27** so that is what I'd recommend if you'd like to test it out yourself. Also to be noted, my development server is the Apache Web Server and the project is currently configured around that. Thus the .htaccess files throughout. This will likely change in the future.

### License Info
This project utilizes **The MIT License**, for more information check the LICENSE file in the root directory.

##### Minor Note
Though I have had  a fair amount of experience programming over the past three years, I am very much a PHP beginner as I start this project, so if you happen to have any recommendations for how to improve this project or my code readability feel free to reach out and let me know.
